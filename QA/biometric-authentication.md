# Biometric Authentication Test Cases

## Overview
This document outlines test cases for the biometric authentication functionality in the FindForce application. The test cases cover hardware detection, user enrollment, authentication flow, error handling, and platform-specific behavior.

## Test Environment Setup

### Required Devices
- iOS device with Face ID
- iOS device with Touch ID
- Android device with fingerprint sensor
- Android device with face recognition
- Web browser (for platform compatibility testing)

### Test User Accounts
- New user (no biometric setup)
- Existing user (with biometric enabled)
- Blocked user
- User without biometric enrollment

## 1. Hardware Detection Tests

### TC-BIO-001: Biometric Hardware Availability
**Objective:** Verify that the application correctly detects biometric hardware
**Steps:**
1. Launch application on device
2. Check `isAvailable` state in `useBiometrics` hook

**Expected Results:**
- iOS/Android with biometric hardware: `isAvailable = true`

- Web platform: `isAvailable = false`

### TC-BIO-002: Biometric Type Detection
**Objective:** Verify correct identification of biometric type
**Steps:**
1. Launch application on different devices
2. Check `biometricType` value

**Expected Results:**
- Face ID device: `biometricType = 'facial'`
- Touch ID/Fingerprint device: `biometricType = 'fingerprint'`
- Iris scanner: `biometricType = 'iris'`
- No biometric hardware: `biometricType = null`

## 2. Enrollment Flow Tests

**Objective:** Verify proper handling when user declines biometric setup
**Steps:**
1. Log in with valid credentials
2. Observe biometric setup prompt
3. Click "Not now"

**Expected Results:**
- Prompt dismisses
- User proceeds to main app
- Biometric remains disabled (`isEnabled = false`)
- User can still use password login

## 3. Authentication Flow Tests

### TC-BIO-005: Successful Biometric Login
**Objective:** Verify successful login using biometrics
**Prerequisites:** User has enabled biometric login

- User accesses main app
- Correct user session established

### TC-BIO-006: Failed Biometric Authentication
**Objective:** Verify handling of failed biometric attempts
**Steps:**
1. Launch app
2. Attempt biometric login
3. Provide invalid biometric (wrong finger/face)

**Expected Results:**
- Error message displayed
- Option to retry or use password
- Authentication state remains locked
- Security policies enforced

### TC-BIO-007: Biometric Fallback
**Objective:** Verify fallback to password login
**Steps:**
1. Launch app
2. Attempt biometric login
3. Click "Use password instead"

**Expected Results:**
- Smooth transition to password login
- All login form fields accessible
- Previous errors cleared

## 4. Error Handling Tests

### TC-BIO-008: Hardware Error Recovery
**Objective:** Verify app behavior when biometric hardware fails
**Steps:**
1. Disable device biometric hardware
2. Attempt biometric login
3. Re-enable hardware
4. Retry authentication

**Expected Results:**
- Appropriate error message
- Graceful fallback to password
- Recovery when hardware available

### TC-BIO-009: Network Error Handling
**Objective:** Verify behavior during network issues
**Steps:**
1. Enable airplane mode
2. Attempt biometric login
3. Restore network connection
4. Retry authentication

**Expected Results:**
- Network error message
- Option to retry
- Successful recovery when network restored

## 5. Security Tests

### TC-BIO-010: Session Management
**Objective:** Verify secure session handling with biometric login
**Steps:**
1. Login with biometrics
2. Check session token
3. Force app background
4. Return to app

**Expected Results:**
- Secure session established
- Proper token management
- Session policies enforced

### TC-BIO-011: Multiple Failed Attempts
**Objective:** Verify security policies for failed attempts
**Steps:**
1. Repeatedly fail biometric authentication
2. Monitor app behavior
3. Check lockout policies

**Expected Results:**
- Attempt counting works
- Lockout after threshold
- Proper user notification
- Recovery process available

## 6. Platform Specific Tests

### TC-BIO-012: iOS Specific Tests
**Objective:** Verify iOS-specific biometric behaviors
**Steps:**
1. Test Face ID animations
2. Verify Touch ID pressure sensitivity
3. Check system prompt styling

**Expected Results:**
- Native iOS feel
- System prompts match iOS style
- Proper hardware integration

### TC-BIO-013: Android Specific Tests
**Objective:** Verify Android-specific biometric behaviors
**Steps:**
1. Test fingerprint sensor feedback
2. Verify face unlock integration
3. Check system prompt styling

**Expected Results:**
- Native Android feel
- System prompts match Android style
- Proper hardware integration

### TC-BIO-014: Web Platform Tests
